Had a tough day?
Had one too many pingers?
Caught your dick in a ceiling fan?
Kick back, relax, and chill out to a frosty can of bunko pepi.

The first time I had bunko pepi I was like
"What the fuck is this"
But now my life has a taken a chilled and refreshing turn thanks to bunko pepi

THE WORLD WILL KNOW THE FLAVOUR OF MEME
Original Bunko Pepi will be our take off
That frosty beverage running down the throat wiill have our customers begging for me
Soon every man, women and child will succumb to the delicious and frosty beverage we have come to call Bunko Pepi

Behold gents, years from today people will speak of the day Bunko Pepi was created
And they will say
Man, these guys surely knew how to frosty a beverage
Passing into legend It shall be known as the frostiest beverage of all time
